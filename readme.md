===
Identifies your out of date project dependencies and shows the latest version you need to upgrade to.

YOU DEPEND ON OTHER PROJECTS.
YOU WANT TO STAY UP TO DATE.
MARVIN'S GOT YOUR BACK.

Got a [maven](https://maven.apache.org/) project? Get a badge.

Marvin gets you an overview of your project dependencies, the version you use and the latest available, so you can quickly see what's drifting. 
Then it's all boiled down into a badge showing the current status, which you can embed on your site.

Inspired by [david](https://david-dm.org/).
